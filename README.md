## Folder Structure
- src
  - components
  - screens
  - navigation
  - services
  - utils
  - constants
  - redux (optional, for state management)
  - assets
  - themes

## Design Pattern
1. **Component-based Architecture**: Break down your UI into reusable components.
2. **Container/Presenter (or Smart/Dumb) Components**: Separate business logic from presentational components.
3. **Navigation**: Handle app navigation using libraries like React Navigation.
4. **Services**: Abstract away business logic and API calls into separate service files.
5. **State Management** (optional): Manage global state with Redux or Context API.
6. **Utils**: Place utility functions and helper methods here.
7. **Constants**: Store API URLs and configuration settings here.
8. **Assets and Themes**: Store images, fonts, and centralize styling and theming.

## Additional Tips
- Use TypeScript for type safety.
- Implement unit and integration tests.
- Follow best practices like code splitting and lazy loading.
- Regularly refactor and review your codebase for maintainability.
